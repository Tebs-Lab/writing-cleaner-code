# Getting and Getting Feedback About Code

Feedback is a critical component of improvement. All creative endeavors can be improved upon. No matter your own skill level, you can always improve as well. That said, not all feedback leads to improvement. The impact of any feedback depends both on the quality of the advice and the openness of the recipient to the feedback. 

Here are some things to keep in mind when giving and getting feedback about computer programs.

## 1. Give Feedback In The Spirit of Improvement

Your goal when giving feedback should be to help the recipient improve. Whether it's the code, their skill in writing code, their professionalism, or something else â€” you should be keenly focused on making things better.

If your feedback isn't meant to improve something, why are you giving it?

## 2. Accept Feedback In The Spirit It Was Given

When someone gives you feedback, hopefully they are following rule number one. As such, receive that feedback understanding that the person giving it to you wants to help. It's easy to be hurt by criticism, but if you understand intent of the feedback was only to help you improve, it will be easier accept the feedback and make some positive changes to your work.

## 3. You Are Not Your Code

Try not to take feedback personally. Comments about your code are not comments about you. The more you can separate your (natural) emotional attachment to your work from the product itself, the easier it will be to accept feedback and continuously improve your code.

## 4. Advice is Better Than Critique

Identifying a problem is only a small part of the battle. If you identify something you don't like in someone's code, go the extra mile and propose a solution or alternative. If you can't think of a good solution, you should mention that in your feedback. 

Something like "I think this line of code is confusing, but I haven't been able to think of a great alternative," invites the original writer to attempt improvements while also recognizing that it's a tricky problem that might not have an obvious solution.

## 5. You Are Not Required To Agree

Just because someone gives you feedback does not mean you have to incorporate it into your work. To some extent the editorial process is inherently subjective. You are the ultimate owner of your own work and your own code, so you should ultimately decide what is best for it.

You should be open minded to the feedback you receive, but that doesn't mean you need to abandon or ignore your own instincts, intuition, and preferences. 

## 6. If You're Looking For Something Specific, Ask For It Specifically

Sometimes we need advice about a particular aspect of our code. Other times we aren't ready for advice about some sections of our code. If there is something you want the reviewer to focus on, or something you want them to ignore, tell them that up front. A little bit of guidance can be very helpful for the reviewer, and save everyone time.

## 7. If Someone Asks For Something Specific, Try To Stay On Target

If someone asks you to review a particular section of their code, do not take it upon yourself to mark up the rest of the codebase as well. 

There could be any number of reasons why they asked you about something specific. Perhaps the rest of the codebase is already being refactored. Perhaps they are about to delete or deprecate large sections of the code. Perhaps they know some sections of the codebase are just not ready yet, and intend to make sweeping changes that will render your comments irrelevant. Whatever their reason, respect the wishes of the person asking for feedback. The recipient will be much more open to feedback they requested than unsolicited feedback. 

If you think it is important to provide additional feedback, consider asking the other person if they want that kind of feedback **before** you start evaluating other aspects of their code.

## 8. Always Be Kind And Compassionate

Most people don't like to be criticized. Sometimes feedback is hard or even painful to receive. Assume the person you're critiquing put a great deal of effort into their work, and critique them with that high effort level in mind. 

Your audience is more likely to take what you say to heart if they know it comes from a place of love and kindness. Being direct, candid, and honest is not an excuse to be mean or judgmental.

If the recipient know you want to help them improve, they will be grateful for your advice even when it means being critical of their work. If the recipient thinks you're just trying to tear them down, they will likely reject your advice even if it might have improved their code. Plus, you risk damaging your working relationship with this person.
