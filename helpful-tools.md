# Helpful Tools For Keeping Code Clean

## 1. A Linter

Most IDEs have support for a tool called a "linter" which is very much like spelling and grammar check for code. Linters typically support a configurable style guide and will give you the standard red-squiggly underlining when it can detect a style guide violation. From variable names to proper indentation, a linter can save you a lot of hassle and nit-picking during the editorial process.

## 2. A Diff Tool

Comparing two code files side by side with a diff tool can help you see changes more concretely, and evaluate the impact of the changes on readability. As an added benefit, many of these tools are also helpful when working on merge conflicts in your version control system.

## 3. Code Auto-Formatters

Many IDEs support automatic code formatting. Like a linter, these are often configurable to conform with your particular style guide. One example of such a tool is [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), which works both as a standalone tool and has integrations/plugins to work with many IDEs and text editors. This [Github repo has a large list of code formatters](https://github.com/rishirdua/awesome-code-formatters).
