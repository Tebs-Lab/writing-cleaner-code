# Write Cleaner Code

This repository contains a selection of advice and examples for writing cleaner code. Entire books can, and have, been written on the subject (e.g. [Clean Code by Robert Martin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/)). These materials are primarily intended to help run workshops and lessons on writing cleaner code. They serve as a brief, but helpful, reference for some of the most common bits of advice.

This repo is also meant to facilitate better feedback among programmers. An editorial process like code review will help programmers write cleaner code. Engaging in code review exposes programmers to other styles and helps with better understanding likes and dislikes about different coding styles for finding your own.

While the focus of this content is on Python, there are fundmental similarities between it and R that are critical to understand for any programmer. These fundamentals will be covered as an exercise in identifying the utility of these comparable languages, and why or where one may be preferably used over another. 

## Using This Repository

Although there is no explicit ordering to this content, when facilitating a workshop or working through these samples on your own, the following order is suggested:

1. [General Advice](general-advice.md)
1. [Giving and Receiving Feedback](giving-and-getting-feedback.md)
1. [Examples](examples/) *note that while these are in Python, they apply to both languages
    1. [Naming Variables](examples/variable-naming.py), and [R equivalent](https://csgillespie.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/r-style-guide/)
    1. [Brevity vs Clarity](examples/brevity-vs-clarity-KISS.py), and [R equivalent](http://stat405.had.co.nz/r-style.html)
    1. [Don't Repeat Yourself](examples/DRY.py) or "DRY" vs "WET", see above link for R equivalent
    1. [Documentation and Comments](examples/documentation-comments.py), and [R equivalent](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/06-best-practices-R/)
    1. [Code Structure and Logic](examples/structure.py), and [R equivalent](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/Sta323_Sp16/R.html)
1. [Helpful Tools and Resources For Clean Code and Review](helpful-tools.md)
