# Writing Cleaner Code

This repository contains a selection of advice and examples of writing cleaner code. Entire books can, and have, been written on the subject (e.g. [Clean Code by Robert Martin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/)). These materials are primarily intended to help run workshops and lessons on writing cleaner code. They serve as a brief but helpful reference for some of the most common bits of advice related to writing cleaner code.

This repo is also meant to facilitate better feedback among programmers. An editorial process like code review will help programmers write cleaner code. Engaging in code review will expose programmers to other styles and help you better understand what you like and dislike about different coding styles!
